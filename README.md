# Ideas Worth Vending

Ideas Worth Vending is a network of art vending machines around Sydney, providing affordable and accessible art from local artists. This repo is the project's website, hosted on GitHub Pages. It's online at **[ideasworthvending.com](https://ideasworthvending.com)**. Much of the information on the site is speculative at the moment, as the project is still in its early stages.

There's also an online interactive vending machine, which you can access [on this page](https://ideasworthvending.com/virtual-vending-machine.html), allowing you to experience what it's like to use one of our vending machines.

                <h1>Contribute</h1>

                <p>Our project is focused on artists and their work, and we're more than happy to get in touch with you if you're interested in contributing.</p>

                <p>At the moment this project is still in the launch phase, however if you'd like the get in contact with us the best way would be to <a href="https://instagram.com/ideasworthvending/">reach out to us on Instragram</a>.</p>

                <p>Once our network of vending machines is up and running, this page will contain information for any artists interested in contributing, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>- What kind of art we're focused on&mdash;minor pieces, not big premium ones</li>
                    <li>- Size constraints so that the work fits in our machines</li>
                    <li>- Details about payment for your work</li>
                    <li>- Locations available</li>
                    <li>- Approximate expected sales numbers, based on previous data</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Partnerships & Residencies</h2>

                <p>We'll also be looking to partner with artists who are interested in becoming more involved with the project. Information about that will be listed here, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>- Filling an entire machine with just your work</li>
                    <li>- Collaborations to design the outside of the machine itself, whether with wraps or something else</li>
                    <li>- Possibly commissioning work specifically for our vending machines</li>
                    <li>- Discussing the nature of art in vending machines, maybe as a new subgenre</li>
                </ul>

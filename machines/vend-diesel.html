                    <h1>Vend Diesel</h1>

                    <p>Vend Diesel is a vending machine located at the Garden Lounge Creative Space in Newtown. It was the first vending machine we put together, and served as a proof of concept for our art vending machine network.</p>

                    <p>It's covered in a collage of images taken from various magazines and books, and is currently filled with works produced by both artists and the project's original team members. </p>

                    <p>Inside you can find a range of zines, art prints, post cards and bookmarks, each ranging in price from $2 to $8. Vend Diesel is an older model vending machine, so only takes coins, and doesn't provide change.</p>

                    <p>You can preview the items inside using our <a href="../machine.html">online virtual vending machine</a>, but to see what's inside each item you'll need to visit Vend Diesel in person and pick something up yourself!</p>
